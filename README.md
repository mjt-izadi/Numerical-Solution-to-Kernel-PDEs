# Numerical Solution to Kernel PDEs
## Implementing a numerical solution to kernel PDEs in backstepping control of PDEs

Backstepping method is a powerful approach in the control of systems modeled by partial differential equations (PDEs). Examples of such systems are conductive heat transfer, wave equation, and delay system. The development of this approach goes back to the works of [Liu (2003)](https://doi.org/10.1137/S0363012902402414) and [Smyshlyaev and Krstic (2004)](https://doi.org/10.1109/TAC.2004.838495). As a boundary control method, PDE backstepping has been widely studied in academia
